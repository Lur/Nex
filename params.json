{"name":"Nex","tagline":"Minecraft Administration, Economy/Sign Shops, and Game Mechanics Plugin","body":"### Welcome\r\nNex is an Administration, Economy / Sign Shops, and Game Mechanics plugin All-In-One. Disable which features you don't want via the configuration file, e.g if you wanted to disable the NexMechanics you could change the line \"NexMechanics_Enabled = true\" to \"NexMechanics_Enabled = false\" in the file \"/Plugins/Nex/config.ini\"\r\n\r\n### Downloads\r\n* You can download the Nex Package which contains all of the Nex plugins by clicking \"Download .zip file\" or \"Download .tar.gz file\" on the right\r\n* PermissionsEx on bukkit\r\n* Latest version of <a href=\"#\">Nex</a> (Nex without any of its associated plugins)\r\n* <a href=\"#\">SQLite</a> and optionally <a href=\"#\">SQLite Browser</a> for viewing and editing the DB file.\r\n\r\n### How It Works\r\nNex uses a SQLite database to save player data, shop data, and anything else that might need saved.\r\n\r\n### How To Use\r\nYou aren't required to use all of the Nex plugins, but they work best together. To use any of the Nex plugins you need <a href=\"#\">SQLite</a> since Nex uses an SQLite DB to store all needed data.\r\n\r\n1. Download the Nex Plugin\r\n2. Place the plugin in /Server_Directory/Plugins/\r\n3. Run your server and Nex should automatically create a folder within your /Plugins/ folder, open it and edit the NexCore configuration file and the configuration file for whichever plugin(s) you downloaded.\r\n4. Place the \"server.db\" file in /Plugins/Nex/ so it looks like \"/Your_Server_Directory/Plugins/Nex/server.db\"\r\nYour server should now be running successfully with Nex. To view and change data like sign shops, edit the \"server.db\" file.\r\n\r\n### Permissions\r\n**NexCore**\r\nBan Command\r\n* Nex.mb | Nex.hr | Nex.dy | Nex.wk\r\nLog Management\r\n* Nex.xraylogs.view | Nex.xraylogs.clear\r\n* Nex.stafflogs.view | Nex.stafflogs.clear\r\nNexSQL\r\n* Nex.db.new | Nex.db.add | Nex.db.del | Nex.db.wipe\r\n\r\n### Nex Commands\r\n* ![bantime][mb|hr|dy|wk] [Player] [reason]\r\n!25mb testuser You're banned from the server for 25 minutes because you did not follow the rules.<br>\r\n!3dy testuser You're banned from the server for 3 days because you did not follow the rules.<br>\r\n!ban testuser You're permanently banned from the server because you did not follow the rules.<br>\r\n!xraylogs [view|clear] - View suspected x-ray users or clear out the x-ray logs from the DB.<br>\r\n!stafflogs [view|clear] - View suspected admin abusers or clear out the staff logs from the DB.<br>\r\n\r\n### NexSQL Commands\r\n* !db [wipe] [optional:table] - Wipe's the database or table clean.\r\n!db wipe testTbl (Would completely clear all rows from the table \"testTbl\")<br>\r\n!db wipe (Would completely clear all rows from all tables)\r\n* !db [new|add|del] [table_name] [args]\r\n!db new Players id(int),Username(string),Password(string) (Creates a new table \"Players\")<br>\r\n!db add Players 1,TestUsr,TestPwd123 (Adds a new row within the table \"Players\")<br>\r\n!db del Players Players 1 (Deletes a specific row from \"Players\" using only the ID specified)<br>\r\n\r\n### NexEco Commands\r\nWill be added soon.\r\n### NexMechanics Commands\r\nWill be added soon.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
