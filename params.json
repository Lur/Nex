{"name":"Nex","tagline":"Minecraft Administration, Economy/Sign Shops, and Game Mechanics Plugin","body":"### Welcome\r\nNex is an Administration, Economy / Sign Shops, and Game Mechanics plugin All-In-One. Designed to be modular, you don't need to use every single one of the Nex plugins, you simply download which ones you want and place them in \"/Your_Server_Directory/Plugins/Nex/\"\r\n\r\n### Downloads\r\n* Latest version of <a href=\"#\">Nex Pack</a> (Nex and all of its associated plugins)\r\n* Latest version of <a href=\"#\">Nex</a> (Nex without any of its associated plugins)\r\n* <a href=\"#\">SQLite</a> and <a href=\"#\">SQLite Browser</a> for viewing and editing the DB file.\r\n\r\n### How To Use\r\nYou aren't required to use all of the Nex plugins, but they work best together. To use any of the Nex plugins you need <a href=\"#\">SQLite</a> since Nex uses an SQLite DB to store all needed DB.\r\n\r\n1. Download whichever Nex plugins you want to use.\r\n2. Place them in your MC server's /Plugins/ folder\r\n3. Run your server and Nex should automatically create a folder within your /Plugins/ folder, open it and edit the configuration file.\r\n4. Place the \"server.db\" file in /Plugins/Nex/ so it looks like /Your_Server_Directory/Plugins/Nex/server.db\r\nYour server should now be running successfully with Nex. To view and change data like sign shops, edit the \"server.db\" file.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
