{"name":"Nex","tagline":"Minecraft Administration, Economy/Sign Shops, and Game Mechanics Plugin","body":"### Welcome\r\nNex is an Administration, Economy / Sign Shops, and Game Mechanics plugin All-In-One. Designed to be modular, you don't need to use every single one of the Nex plugins, you simply download which ones you want and place them in \"/Your_Server_Directory/Plugins/Nex/\"\r\n\r\n### Downloads\r\n* You can download the Nex Package which contains all of the Nex plugins by clicking \"Download .zip file\" or \"Download .tar.gz file\" on the right\r\n* Latest version of <a href=\"#\">Nex</a> (Nex without any of its associated plugins)\r\n* <a href=\"#\">SQLite</a> and optionally <a href=\"#\">SQLite Browser</a> for viewing and editing the DB file.\r\n\r\n### How To Use\r\nYou aren't required to use all of the Nex plugins, but they work best together. To use any of the Nex plugins you need <a href=\"#\">SQLite</a> since Nex uses an SQLite DB to store all needed data.\r\n\r\n1. Download whichever Nex plugins you want to use, and unless you're just using Nex Mechanics (Without Nex or any of its associates) you'll also need to download NexSQL to handle the SQLite db.\r\n2. Place your downloaded plugins and NexSQL into your /Plugins/ folder\r\n3. Run your server and Nex should automatically create a folder within your /Plugins/ folder, open it and edit the configuration file.\r\n4. Place the \"server.db\" file in /Plugins/Nex/ so it looks like \"/Your_Server_Directory/Plugins/Nex/server.db\"\r\nYour server should now be running successfully with Nex. To view and change data like sign shops, edit the \"server.db\" file.\r\n\r\n### Nex Commands\r\n\r\n### NexEco Commands\r\n\r\n### NexSQL Commands\r\n* !db <wipe> <optional:table>- Wipe's the database or table clean.\r\n!db wipe testTbl (Would completely clear all rows from the table \"testTbl\")\r\n!db wipe (Would completely clear all rows from all tables)\r\n* !db <new|add|del> <table_name> <args>\r\n!db new Players id(int),Username(string),Password(string) (Creates a new table \"Players\")\r\n!db add Players 1,TestUsr,TestPwd123 (Adds a new row within the table \"Players\")\r\n!db del Players Players 1 (Deletes a specific row from \"Players\" using only the ID specified)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
