{"name":"Nex","tagline":"Minecraft Administration, Economy/Sign Shops, and Game Mechanics Plugin","body":"### Welcome\r\nNex is an Administration, Economy / Sign Shops, and Game Mechanics plugin All-In-One. Designed to be modular, you don't need to use every single one of the Nex plugins, you simply download which ones you want and place them in \"/Your_Server_Directory/Plugins/Nex/\"\r\n\r\n### Downloads\r\n* You can download the Nex Package which contains all of the Nex plugins by clicking \"Download .zip file\" or \"Download .tar.gz file\" on the right\r\n* PermissionsEx on bukkit\r\n* Latest version of <a href=\"#\">Nex</a> (Nex without any of its associated plugins)\r\n* <a href=\"#\">SQLite</a> and optionally <a href=\"#\">SQLite Browser</a> for viewing and editing the DB file.\r\n\r\n### How It Works\r\nNex acts as the core for the plugin(s), and has NexSQL built-in so it can do things like adding new entries and deleting entries from the DB. The other Nex plugins all use Nex for sending queries to the DB, handling commands, etc.\r\n\r\n### How To Use\r\nYou aren't required to use all of the Nex plugins, but they work best together. To use any of the Nex plugins you need <a href=\"#\">SQLite</a> since Nex uses an SQLite DB to store all needed data.\r\n\r\n1. Download whichever plugin(s) you want to use and also download the NexCore.\r\n2. Place your downloaded plugins and NexSQL into your /Plugins/ folder\r\n3. Run your server and Nex should automatically create a folder within your /Plugins/ folder, open it and edit the NexCore configuration file and the configuration file for whichever plugin(s) you downloaded.\r\n4. Place the \"server.db\" file in /Plugins/Nex/ so it looks like \"/Your_Server_Directory/Plugins/Nex/server.db\"\r\nYour server should now be running successfully with Nex. To view and change data like sign shops, edit the \"server.db\" file.\r\n\r\n### Permissions\r\n**NexCore**\r\nBan Command\r\n* Nex.mb | Nex.hr | Nex.dy | Nex.wk\r\nLog Management\r\n* Nex.xraylogs.view | Nex.xraylogs.clear\r\n* Nex.stafflogs.view | Nex.stafflogs.clear\r\nNexSQL\r\n* Nex.db.new | Nex.db.add | Nex.db.del | Nex.db.wipe\r\n\r\n### Nex Commands\r\n*![bantime][mb|hr|dy|wk] [Player] [reason]\r\n!25mb testuser You're banned from the server for 25 minutes because you did not follow the rules.<br>\r\n!3dy testuser You're banned from the server for 3 days because you did not follow the rules.<br>\r\n!ban testuser You're permanently banned from the server because you did not follow the rules.<br>\r\n!xraylogs [view|clear] - View suspected x-ray users or clear out the x-ray logs from the DB.<br>\r\n!stafflogs [view|clear] - View suspected admin abusers or clear out the staff logs from the DB.<br>\r\n\r\n### NexSQL Commands\r\nNote that NexSQL is built-in to the NexCore plugin.\r\n*!db [wipe] [optional:table] - Wipe's the database or table clean.\r\n!db wipe testTbl (Would completely clear all rows from the table \"testTbl\")<br>\r\n!db wipe (Would completely clear all rows from all tables)\r\n*!db [new|add|del] [table_name] [args]\r\n!db new Players id(int),Username(string),Password(string) (Creates a new table \"Players\")<br>\r\n!db add Players 1,TestUsr,TestPwd123 (Adds a new row within the table \"Players\")<br>\r\n!db del Players Players 1 (Deletes a specific row from \"Players\" using only the ID specified)<br>\r\n\r\n### NexEco Commands\r\nWill be added soon.\r\n### NexMechanics Commands\r\nWill be added soon.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
